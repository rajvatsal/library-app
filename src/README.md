<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Javascript part was kind of tricky at first. Making the submit form behave the way I wanted it do, it was challenging. I just wanted to give up, but taking a day and starting fresh the next day I dow it.</li>
        <li>Using gradient to give colors to my elements was fun. I really got my creative juices flowing. In the end 
        I am happy with the result of both design and code</li>
    </ul>
<h2>What I learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I've started to use css for the stuff I used to rely on Javascript. I now understand that CSS can be very powerful if you know how to use it</li>
        <li>I now understand how to use objects and constructors to manage my code. It's really a neat way of doing things.
        I've good grasp on how function invocation change the value of this inside functions or methods</li>  
        <li>I've gotten better with design and also how to implement that design in a code</li>
    </ul>
